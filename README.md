## ✨ What is TGDrive?

TGDrive turns your Telegram account into unlimited cloud storage — directly in your browser. No server, no subscription, no storage limit. Files are stored permanently on Telegram's infrastructure using the official MTProto API.

- **Zero backend** — your browser connects directly to Telegram's servers
- **Zero cost** — completely free, no server to host
- **Unlimited storage** — Telegram has no quota on user accounts
- **Up to 2 GB per file** — Telegram's per-file limit (vs 15 GB for Google Drive)
- **Your data, your device** — credentials and session live only in your browser's IndexedDB

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 **Folder organisation** — folders map to private Telegram channels tagged `[TGDrive]`
- 📤 **File upload** — drag and drop, multi-file, real-time progress bar
- 📥 **File download** — direct download with original filename preserved
- 🖼️ **Image preview** — inline preview without downloading
- 🎬 **Video streaming** — MediaSource API streaming, plays while downloading
- 🔐 **Secure login** — 3-step flow: API credentials → phone → OTP
- 💾 **Persistent session** — stays logged in across refreshes via IndexedDB
- 🌙 **Night theme** — DaisyUI night theme, clean minimal UI
- 📱 **Responsive** — works on desktop and mobile browsers

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

```
Your Browser
├── React UI
├── GramJS (MTProto client — same protocol as official Telegram app)
├── IndexedDB (session, credentials, file metadata cache)
└── Direct WebSocket ──► Telegram MTProto servers
                              └── Your files stored here permanently
```

Folders are **private Telegram channels** prefixed with `[TGDrive]`. Files are sent as document attachments with a JSON caption carrying the original filename, size, MIME type, and upload timestamp — so metadata is always accurate regardless of how Telegram processes the file.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

| Concern | How TGDrive handles it |
|---------|----------------------|
| API credentials | Stored only in your browser's IndexedDB. Never transmitted to any TGDrive server (there is none). |
| Telegram session | Stored in IndexedDB. Automatically kept in sync with Telegram's auth key to prevent session errors. |
| File data | Goes directly from your browser to Telegram's servers via WebSocket. Never touches a TGDrive server. |
| Who can see your files | Only you. Folders are private Telegram channels on your account. |
| If you clear browser data | Session lost, files safe. Log in again and everything reappears. |

> TGDrive has no backend server. The author never sees your credentials, session, or files.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Issues

- **2FA accounts** — Two-factor authentication login is not yet supported
- **File size** — Telegram's per-file limit is 2 GB
- **Video codec support** — MediaSource streaming works for `video/mp4` and `video/webm`. Other formats fall back to full download before playback
- **Session on clear** — Clearing browser data (IndexedDB) requires re-login (files remain safe)
- **Telegram ToS** — Using the MTProto API for storage automation is a grey area. Accounts used heavily for automated uploads could theoretically be flagged

---

## 🚢 Deployment

The repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys automatically on every push to `main`.

### Deploy Your Own Fork

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source** → select **GitHub Actions**
3. Push any change to `main` — the workflow runs automatically
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/tgdrive/`

The base path is detected automatically from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` — no config needed.
