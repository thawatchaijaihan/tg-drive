            TGDrive is a free, open-source web application that turns your existing Telegram account
            into unlimited cloud storage — with no subscriptions, no server costs, and no middleman.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-base-content mb-4">What is TGDrive?</h2>
          <div className="text-base-content/60 space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Telegram is one of the world's largest messaging platforms, with servers distributed
              globally. Every Telegram account comes with effectively unlimited cloud storage —
              files sent to your "Saved Messages" or private channels persist on Telegram's servers
              indefinitely, accessible from any device.
            </p>
            <p>
              TGDrive provides a familiar Google Drive-style interface on top of this storage.
              You create folders (which become private Telegram channels), upload files, preview
              images and stream videos — all through a clean, fast browser interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional cloud storage services, TGDrive has no backend server of its own.
              Your browser connects directly to Telegram's servers using the official MTProto API —
              the same protocol used by Telegram's own apps. Your files, credentials, and session
              data never pass through TGDrive infrastructure because there is no TGDrive infrastructure.
